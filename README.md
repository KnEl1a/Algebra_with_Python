These projects represent the culmination of my university-level Algebra course, incorporating Python programming to apply theoretical concepts in practical computational implementations. 
Through these endeavors, I have synthesized mathematical knowledge gained throughout the course into tangible algoritmic solutions, fostering a deeper understanding of both algebraic principles and
programming methodologies. This integration of mathematical theory with computational tools has not only enriched my academic experience but also equipped me with valuable skills for real-world problem-solving 
in mathematical modeling and analysis.

I completed five projects, including an algebraic calculator, a financial calculator, a graphical polynomial equations calculator, and a very simple graphical data explorer. These projects collectively 
demonstrate my proficiency in applying mathematical principles to develop practical computational tools. The algebraic calculator enables users to perform various algebraic operations and solve equations,
while the financial calculator offers functions tailored for financial analysis and planning. The graphical polynomial equations calculator provides visualization capabilities for polynomial functions, 
enhancing understanding through graphical representation. Additionally, the simple graphical data explorer facilitates basic exploration and visualization of data sets, serving as an introductory tool
for data analysis and visualization.
